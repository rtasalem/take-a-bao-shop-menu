# Take A Bao: Read-Only Shop Menu üë©üèª‚Äçüç≥ü§§
### Acknowledgements
Full credit and a massive thank you for the inspiration behind this project goes to my very talented close friend, Claire Huang. I dedicate this project to her in the hopes that I'll get a lifetime discount on her homemade bao. If you want to find out more about Claire's fundraising work, check out the Take A Bao [Instragram](https://www.instagram.com/_takeabao/) and [Just Giving](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/TakeaBao?utm_term=z2xyP8dk5) pages.

### Just A Heads-Up
When I first told Claire that I was working on this project for her, her excitement further inspired me to develop this idea into what will (hopefully) be a real, full-fledged website where orders can be placed and upcoming and past fundraising events can be viewed as blog-style articles. This large-scale website is currently still in development and will be contained in a separate repository (a link will be provided here in the coming months).
## Background
Take A Bao is a pop-up bao bar founded by my close friend, Claire. When Claire first told me about Take A Bao, I wanted to make a small-scale website for her as a surprise and to develop my skills as a full stack developer. This project comprises a read-only online shop menu - a _very_ early prototype. A RESTful API feeds data from a H2 (in-memory) database to a React application that uses Bootstrap for visually pleasing web pages. 
## Libraries & Technologies
Spring Boot
Figma
Bootstrap
React
## Documentation
## Learning Milestones
This project further exposed me to the Bootstrap framework and how to implement it within React. I also using Figma to create the social media icons for the Instagram and Just Giving pages, which can be seen along the footer of the website. 
## Getting Started
After cloning the repository, import the take-a-bao-api as a Maven project and run it as a Spring Boot Application. The instructions for running the take-a-bao-frontend React application can be found in a dedicated [README.md](https://github.com/rtasalem/take-a-bao-shop-menu/blob/main/take-a-bao-frontend/README.md) file.
