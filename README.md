# Take A Bao: Shop Menu üë©üèª‚Äçüç≥
### Acknowledgements
Full credit and a massive thank you for the inspiration behind this project (and that includes the _genius_ name) goes to my very talented close friend, Claire H. I dedicate this project to her in the hopes that I'll get a lifetime discount on her homemade bao. If you want to find out more about Claire's fundraising work, check out the Take A Bao [Instragram](https://www.instagram.com/_takeabao/) and [Just Giving](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/TakeaBao?utm_term=z2xyP8dk5) pages.
## Background
The idea for this project came about when I was sat at breakfast with Claire and another close friend of ours. Claire described how she was organising a fundraiser where she would be donating a portion of the profits to [Central & West Integration Network](https://www.cwin.org.uk/): a Scottish charity that works towards improving food security, participation, and integration amongst asylum seekers and refugees. To accomplish this, Claire made a menu of baozi and desserts which she would sell during the fundraiser to anyone in attendance. It was from this conversation that I got the idea of building a shop menu with all the items from Claire's original fundraiser menu.
