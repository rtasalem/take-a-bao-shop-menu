# Take A Bao (Shop Menu) 👩🏻‍🍳
### Acknowledgements
Full credit and a massive thank you for the inspiration behind this project (and that includes the genius name: _Take A Bao_) goes to my very talented close friend, Claire H. I dedicate this project to her in the hopes that I'll get a lifetime discount on her homemade bao.
## Background
The idea for this project came about when I was sat at breakfast with Claire and another close friend of ours. Claire described how she was organising a fundraiser where she would be donating a portion of the profits to [Central & West Integration Network]: a Scottish charity that works towards improving food security, participation, and integration amongst asylum seekers and refugees. To accomplish this, Claire made a menu of baozi and desserts which she would sell during the fundraiser to anyone in attendance. It was from this conversation that I got the idea of building a shop menu with all the items from Claire's original fundraiser menu.
